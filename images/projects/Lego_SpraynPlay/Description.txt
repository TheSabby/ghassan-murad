The concept behind this advertising/marketing campaign does not only promote LEGOs mission statement, ìInspire and develop the builders of tomorrow but also provokes consumers to initiate a referral network marketing campaign. The main idea was to ignite a promotional event that is of such simplicity to impact consumers themselves to spread exposure. The subjects are to get a construction block, doesn’t matter the size. However, the bigger the better. With the use of spray paint (or any other form of paint) the subjects are to paint the construction block then get a free LEGO Spray n’ Play sticker from the nearest Lego distributer, stick it on the block, take photos of the painted block with the sticker in an interesting spot, post the photo on facebook with the hashtag #spraynplay and the subject with an interesting photo would be contacted to receive a gift from LEGO.
